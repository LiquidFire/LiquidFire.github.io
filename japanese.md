## [Hiragana to Katakana User Script](/user-scripts/hiragana-to-katakana.user.js)

A browser user script that converts hiragana on every site you visit to
katakana. Great if you want to get more practice reading katakana.

Warning: I recommend _not_ using this until you can read hiragana effortlessly
and know very well the situations in which each script would be used.

## [Numbers Listening Practice](/japanese/numbers-listening/)

A very simple web app that will read numbers to you and you have to then type
them in.

## [Japanese Weekday Tray](https://github.com/LiquidFire/japanese-weekday-tray/)

A simple desktop application that shows the kanji for the current day of the
week as a system tray icon.

Written in Python; requires PySide. Currently there is no convenient
installer/package; you have to manually set it up.

_(Yes, I am aware 14-09-2013 was not a Friday; I was simply using é‡‘ for the
screenshot because it looks the fanciest)_
